This plugin can be used in the following way:

```RUBY
github_job_status(
  token: 'github_OAuth_token',

  repo: 'fastlane_plugins',
  sha: 'commit_sha',
  job_name: 'good_job',
  description: 'A short description',
  build_url: 'skullcrushers.gov',
  state: 'pending'
)
```

 * `state` must be pending, success, error, or failure
